    "<b>Second</b>: commit <b> </b><br/> \n",
    "\n",
    "- got rid of excel writing (more memory efficient since we are already saving csv; less data lost in case of error/break; simpler)\n",
    "- shortened time of sql vars\n",
    "- modified run / streamline and adjusted to modified functions and classes\n",
    "- annotations to Counts and run \n",
    "- ran and debugged run (works for selected indexes of nate's data) !!\n",

    "Checkpoint for Counts edits with the following changes\n",
    "- separate qgm_counts_df construction and filtered_df construction for modularity\n",
    "- \"construct_qgm_counts_df\" is the same as the first half of defunct 'construct_df'\n",
    "- new \"construct_filtered_df\" \n",
    "--- takes qgm_counts_df, counts no. molecs and reads PF, named 'molecs' and 'reads' henceforth, and \n",
    "--- filter data by molec(PF) > 0 and all features non-null\n",

    "Checkpoint for finishing Counts (ugh finally) and fixing Index\n",
    "- in Index.count_reads, should be type(counts[key] )==list (not np.array -- don't know why it doesn't work. It's probably fixable but i can't deal with it right now because I need to finish all of this other schtuff)\n",
    "- in Counts, constructed generators to manipulate df as static methods:\n",
    "--- 'parse_qgm_key' from input tuple\n",
    "--- 'calculate_count_minscore' to count total and pf reads, bool(molec_passed) according to minscore\n",
    "--- free memory: drop qscore seqs, and eg return intermediate qgm_df to outer function (instead of as property) \n",
    "--- count no. molecs and reads which PF per qg\n",
    "--- set Counts.qg_df property\n",
    "- added xlsx, csv saving functionalities\n",

    "- in progress: amending 'run' to align with other changes, and streamline/declutter; annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (Next:  catching exceptions!!!!!!) also, maybe format motif function to ease user input requirements (e.g. instead of {ATCG}, convert \".\" in function to clean up user input)\n",
