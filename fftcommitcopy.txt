completed fft transformation method and used it to analyze mouse data and a few samples of nate's colonies. looks good so far; need to test on ratio and other validation data to verify. there seem to be areas around lower num barcodes (?) that result in variable results among biological replicates. don't know if this is biologically related or silico error. Also created graphs to represent FFT process, compiling results of reps, etc. ppt of these preliminary developments is also included.
